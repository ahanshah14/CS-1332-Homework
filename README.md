# CS 1332 - Data Structures &amp; Algorithms
These are IntelliJ IDEA modules that contain CS 1332 Fall '17 homework solutions
and have been tested against student-made junit tests. Please let me know if you
find any errors or better/more efficient implementations aside from my own. This
repository serves to educate and provide insight to widely known data structures
and algorithms. I will not be held responsible for intentions other than that.
Use at your own discretion.
